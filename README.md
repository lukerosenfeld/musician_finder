# musician_finder
CS411 Project

To run this app, go to /nodestuff/web-api-auth-examples/authorization_code and run "node app.js" from the command line.

This will get the app running on localhost:8888. Enter localhost:8888 into your favorite web browser, and the site will appear. 

Note: I have aborted using meteor for this, because it seemed to be interfering with running the app through node. Node allows for more flexibility than meteor, anyways. So as for now, the folder "musician_proj" is outdated and not being used. All currently relevant files are in "nodestuff".

**Assignment 3**
All files for problems 1-4 can be found in the Assignment-3 folder. For problem 5, follow the steps above to run the app.
